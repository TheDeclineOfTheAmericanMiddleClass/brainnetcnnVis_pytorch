# brainnetcnnVis_pytorch
# Pytorch implementation of BrainNetCNN (Kawahara et al. 2016), visualization of results, shallow models for comparison

# "preprocessing.degrees_of_freedom" to choose the dataset used to train, early stopping parameters
# "analysis.train_model" to train the model
# "analysis.plot_model_results" to visualize learning
# "analysis.save_trained_model" to save the training scores, hyperparameters, and weights
# "analysis.train_shallow_networks.py" to train an ElasticNet, SVM, and MLP, for comparative results
